# Bridging Graph Position Encodings for Transformers with Weighted Graph-Walking Automata

This repository contains the code for the paper ["Bridging Graph Position Encodings for Transformers with Weighted Graph-Walking Automata" (Soga and Chiang, 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06898). We draw heavily on code from ["Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks" (Dwivedi et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00982).
